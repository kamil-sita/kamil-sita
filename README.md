### Projects to be added (and finished before adding here)

* Image-Copy-Finder - slightly rewritten version of my thesis - an advanced system that allows for near duplicate search for images. Can use database via Hibernate to 
store pre-computed information. Modular, allows for adding new related systems and comparison methods of images.

* gamepad - ATMega32u4-based gamepad that works like a keyboard

* some other university projects before I lose their source code

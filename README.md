## Hello there

If you are looking for someone who writes almost everything in the same one boring language, I'm your guy.

## Some more exciting projects

Unless specified otherwise, projects below are written in Java.

### Usable projects

* [XIS](https://github.com/kamil-sita/XIS) - JavaFX based application that contains modules relating to finding duplicate images, conversion of images and pdfs to more "printable" format (via High Pass Filter or Quantization filter) and some fancy compression algorithm that is currently broken

* [simple_kmeans](https://github.com/kamil-sita/simple_kmeans) - K-Means algorithm implementation

* [simple-image-classifier](https://github.com/kamil-sita/simple-image-classifier) - Image Classifier based on artificial neural networks, with GUI

* [xge-games-archive](https://github.com/kamil-sita/xge-games-archive) - archive of my custom game engine + 3 games that use the engine, including Floodtown - a Ludum Dare 42 entry

* [ams-convolution](https://github.com/kamil-sita/asm-convolution) - high level (C#) + low level (x64 assembly) implementation of algorithm that applies 1-dimensional kernel to image

* [cpp-roguelike](https://github.com/kamil-sita/cpp-roguelike) - roguelike written in C++ + SFML.

* [simple-traffic-simulator](https://github.com/kamil-sita/simple-traffic-simulator) - traffic simulator written in C++ + SFML.

* [Fitt's Law](https://github.com/kamil-sita/pwsgu) - group project written in Unity - Fitt's Law testing in 2D and augmeneted reality 

### Not very usable projects

* [wave-engine](https://github.com/kamil-sita/wave-engine) - Entity-Component-System based, multithreaded game engine. Contains examples 

### Projects to be added

* Image-Copy-Finder - slightly rewritten version of my thesis - an advanced system that allows for near duplicate search for images. Can use database via Hibernate to 
store pre-computed information. Modular, allows for adding new related systems and comparison methods of images.

* SLang Compiler - mostly non-optimizing compiler of custom basic C-like programming language  

* gamepad - ATMega32u4-based gamepad that works like a keyboard

* some other university projects before I lose their source code

### Things not to be added

* rushed group projects
